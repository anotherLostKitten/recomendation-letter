# recomendation-letter
for none other than @AzureLobster#4819

@AzureLobster#4819 is a true scholar because he is one of the most dedicated members of the stuyvesant computer interaction club, therefore, he clearly is a truly an intellectual with the greatest of tastest, and a point of shining light amoung the sea of mediocrity that comprimizes the human race, and, furtherovermore, he is not only an active member of the computer interaction club but is in matter of fact no less than completely being in fact the mitochondria of the computer interactoin club -- yes, this is right, correct, the mitochondria, not anything less, but in fact the very POWERHOUSE of the computer interaction club, as is clearly evidenced by his musty, manly odour and exhumation of sexyliness of the good fella, who goes by the alias lobster, which is in fact a reference to the famous crustacean and luxury food which is infact also called a lobster and is a crustacean, which further showcases @AzureLobster#4819 excellent tastes in both clubs to attend at stuyvesant high school, and in crustaceans, truly being an intellectual he is, also, he is clearly dedicated to the advancement of scholarliness through the high-brow cinematrographic journeys embarked upon in the very same stuyvesant computer interaction club which @AzureLobster#4819 is in fact officially declared of by the leadership of the stuyvesant computer interaction club (which is to say in the most emphatic and truthfully correct sense wholly and completely no other than theodore peters, which is to say in fact none other than myself, theodore peters, second president and in all effectiveityness none other than the leader of the stuyvesant computer interaction club in every shape, form, and polygon except for the exclusivity of that which is designated my moniker, so is which to say in fact name), and this previously mentioned fact that i mentioned in this letter of recomendation written by me, theodore peters, second president and effectively none other than the leader of the stuyvesant computer interactoin club, and also as i am head of public outreach and treasurer and secratary and cofounder and server owner of said club, as he was the sole well-mannered attendee of the infamous killer klowns from outerspace watching party in which he was the sole attendee of the killer klowns from outerspace watching party who did not FUCKIGN INTERUPT THE FUCKING MOVIE BY BEING A NOISY FUCKING BITCH THAT FUCKING INTERUPPTED THE SHIT OUT OF THE FCKING MOVIE KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE, and in all finality of that which one does to in fact change the subject of conversation, in conclusion, @AzureLobster#4819, mitochondria and regular attendee of the stuyvesant computer interaction club, that is to say the very best club at stuyvesant, which is in fact the premier institution of intellectuals to ever congrate at the venerable institution which is stuyvesant high school, named stuyvesant after a reference to some man from antisemetic who was amsterdam, the very same, yes indeed in all unadultered honesty, in fact that who is known as in the textbooks of history as none other that peter stuyvesant, the peter in his name in fact being nothing less that a highly intellectual and intellectual reference to the obscure mythological creature colloquially refered to by society, that is to say the amalgalation of the common man headed over by an oppressive and tyranicall government that posseses the qualitys of tyranicallity and opresivitityness, as none other that peter parker AKA (which in point of fact is that which is called an acronym, which is what is described in points of factiods as a congregation of letters in a sequence, as is a word, but in fact is disimilar and different that a word in being that instead of describing and pertaininght to an idea of a specific meaning as does that which is refered to as a word, it infact applies to a collection of words, and in this example AKA is infact in all sheerest of honesty is honestly short for also known as, which is infact a synonym, which is in case you were unaware a way of describing the same meaning as referenced by a word in such a manner that was previously described in my discussion of acronymns, yes that is right a meaning designated by two different words in such a sense that the two words do nothing less but all truthality pertain to the meaning which between the two might be considered the same, and this aforementioned synonym that aka is for, but obvi8ously this is based on a somewhat looser form of the definition of the word synonym as in fact aka is in fact not in fact a word but is in fact rather an acronym, which the experienced reader will remnember is in fact differnet that a word in exactly the maner and sense i described above, is in fact no less than no more that which is no less than a synonym for the word is also called by some nerds) none other than spider man, a remarkeable name in the sense that it applies one to be both man and spider, in such a sense that both labels can be combined into what is infact one hybrid label, namely "spider man", but in all truthfullness and honesty, likely only a creature of purely that miscelaneous subgenre of what we refer to as literature that we refer to as fiction, is truly a scholar and an intellectual that should most completely, honestly, truthfully, point-of-factilly, and sincerely, be given immediate admission to you venerable institution refered to you as that which is called a college, and in fact is so qualified from admission and attendance of any and all such institutions that in any and all ways of looking at this current situation which we, that is to say you and not me as i am merely writing this aforementioned letter of recomendation that you hold in your very two hands, that is right none other than in fact your own two hands which are in point of fact attached to the region of your body refered to as the torso, and seeing as how my function in this endevaour being undertaked by the noble and intellectual and gentlemanly lobster, as was proven before as having in fact those quantities in complete and utter abundance, along with other quantities so numerous and fantastic that it would be in all point of fact completely impossible and inconcieveable for me to list them all here, that is to say in this letter of recomendation that you hold in none other than your aforementioned arms, which are in poibnt of fact attached to your aforementioned body, and because of the nature of @AzureLobster#4819 's schollarly and intellectual qualities which he posseses in abundance of the utmost variety and kind and the nature of the situation in which you find yourselves such as that you are in fact considering @AzureLobster#4819 , the complete and honest truth of the matter is that rather than compelling and coercing @AzureLobster#4819 into applying into the aforementioned institution, which includes in all obviouslness all of its aforementioned venerabality (which was also aforementioned), but rather in all point of fact we should see a reversal of roles, that is to say a situation in which roles are reversed as compared to the current state that roles exist in in the situation we currently find ourselves (and of course it needs to be menioned here, that is to say at this moment in this aforementioned letter of recomendation, that the same aforementioned stiplulations and qualifications on the use of the statement "we" apply as applied in the previous time, that is to say the time which was in terms of chronology most recent but also satisfied the chronological condition of being considered as having occured in what we, by which i mean in a total different sense of the word that is we, as in such as that which applies to the human race in general, consider to be the passage of time, that i considered in these synactial innoculalities which are refered to as parenthesis, the meanings of the word "we"), that is to say in such a situation in which you and the institution that you represent are in fact begging for lobster to grace the aforementioned veneralability of your institution with his infinitely and indefinetely higher venerability that pertains in completeness and wholly to that which is refered to by his person,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Sincerely, that is in fact to say without wax, as is a reference to the historical period in time in which that which is refered to by paintings was made by that which is reffered to by artists and when aforementioned artists creating said paintings inevitably and irretifiably made that which is known as a mistake, they would cover up such mistake with the use of that which is refered to as wax, and in such concluding my aforementioned letter of recomendation as such, i mean to explicitly imply that accepting @AzureLobster#4819 to you venerable institution would in all point of fact not be a mistake such as would be needed to be covered over by the use of wax but would in all manner and point of fact be the best possible course of action that any given individual could have undertaked and any given time, which is to say wholly a good idea, Theodore Peters, Second President, Effective sole club leader, cofounder, head of public outreach, secretary, treasurer, stuyvesant computer interaction club
